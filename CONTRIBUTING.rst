This package has been developed for teaching illustrations.

Please use the GitHub *Issues* feature to raise questions concerning potential
bugs or to propose new features, but search and read resolved/closed topics on
similar subjects before raising a new issue.

For contributions to the code base, please use GitHub *Pull Requests*,
including a detailed description of the new feature and unit tests
to illustrate the intended functionality.
Code submitted via pull requests must adhere to the `pep8`_ style formats
and the documentation should follow  the `numpydoc docstring guide`_.

We do not require users to sign a *Contributor License Agreement*, because we
believe that when posting ideas or submitting code to an open-source project,
it should be obvious and self-evident that any such contributions
are made in the spirit of open collaborative development.
